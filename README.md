# Automata

Project for the Algorithms and Data Structures course at University of Brescia.

The project is about deterministic finite automata. The program allows to build custom DFAs (or networks of DFAs) and to perform operations 
on them such as language recognition, computation of the behavioral space, computation of a diagnosis...

👨‍💻 It has been developed using Java adopting the TDD software development model (using JUnit 5). For the creation of graph-based data structures 
we used the Google [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) library.
